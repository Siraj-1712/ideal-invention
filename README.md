Title : **Prediction of loan defaulters**
Goal of the project : **TheÂ main aim of this project is to build a classification model which effectively predicts whether a loan will default or be fully paid**.
objective : **Within this project, we intend to build a machine learning algorithm for the purpose of correctly identifying if a person, given certain characteristics, has a high likelihood to default on a loan. We show an analysis on loan default behavior. Lastly, we show an approach using machine learning to help aid investors/banks in choosing which loan to fund**.

Base model built with all the features in the pre-processed dataset.
Evaluate the metrics of all the models and compare the models with one another to check what needs to be done more to increase the accuracy of the model.
Firstly, We have created baseline model using Logistic Regression and see average accuracy using 5 cross validation as 80% 
Algorithms that will be considered:
-Decision Tree
-Random Forest Classifier
-XGBoost Classifier
-K Nearest Classifier

We used domain understanding and literature survey to reduce the number of attributes by using the relations between them to create new variables and drop the parent variables. This helped us manage the huge dataset we were working on.
